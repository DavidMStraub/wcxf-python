# WCxf Python API and command line interface

This Python package provides a Python API and command line interface to
perform the following operations on WCxf files (or dictionaries):

- *validation* against EFT and basis files,
- *conversion* between JSON and YAML,
- *translation* between different bases, and
- *matching* between different EFTs.

## Installation

Since the package is currently in active development, the preferred way
to install it is in development mode. From the base directory:

```bash
pip3 install -e . --user
```
